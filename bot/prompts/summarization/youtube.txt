Convert the following YouTube video transcript into a structured note with this exact layout and style:

Title line (ALL CAPS words allowed, punchy, 2–5 words)
Length: {duration}

Then include these sections in order:

Summary
- 4–6 bullet points
- Each bullet starts with a relevant emoji + short bolded heading + 1–2 sentence explanation
- Focus on the core narrative, key scenes, and takeaways (no filler, no timestamps)

Insights Based on Numbers
- 1–3 bullets
- Only include quantitative claims (dates, temps, counts, frequencies, measurements). If none exist, write "None mentioned."

Example Exploratory Questions
- Exactly 3 numbered questions
- Each ends with: "(Enter E1 to ask)" / "(Enter E2 to ask)" / "(Enter E3 to ask)"
- Questions should invite deeper reasoning about the content (not trivia)

Rules:
- Keep it concise and skimmable.
- Preserve important proper nouns and locations.
- Do not quote the transcript verbatim; paraphrase.
